# Reverse Integer

Given a number, return the number with its digits reversed. For instance, if the number is 123, the reversed number should be 321.

The number should be within the range of a 32-bit integer. If it exceeds this range, return 0.

A possible solution involves converting the number into a string, reversing it, and then converting it back into an integer.

Afterwards, it's important to verify if the resulting number falls within an acceptable range.
