# How long would each of these operations take in big O notation?
# Creating a multiplication table with all the elements in the array. So if your array is [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], you first
# multiply every element by 2, then multiply every element by 3, then by 7, and so on.

#        2    3    7    8   10
# 2   |  4 |  6 | 14 | 16 | 20  |
# 3   |  6 |  9 | 21 | 24 | 30  |
# 7   | 14 | 21 | 49 | 56 | 70  |
# 8   | 16 | 24 | 56 | 64 | 80  |
# 10  | 20 | 30 | 70 | 80 | 100 |

# O(nÂ²)
