# Remember binary search from chapter 1? It's a D&C algorithm, too. Can you come up with the base case and recursive
# case for binary search?

# The base case for binary search is an array with one item.
# If the item you're looking for matches the item in the array, you found it! Otherwise, it isn't in the array.
# In the recursive case for binary search, you split the array in half, throw away one half, and call binary search on
# the other half.
