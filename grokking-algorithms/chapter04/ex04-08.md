4. Remember binary search from chapter 1? It's a D&C algorithm, too. Can you come up with the base case and recursive case for binary search?

The base case for binary search is an array with one item.

If the item you're looking for matches the item in the array, you found it! Otherwise, it isn't in the array.

In the recursive case for binary search, you split the array in half, throw away one half, and call binary search on the other half.

5. How long would each of these operations take in big O notation? Printing the value of each element in an array.

O(n)

6. How long would each of these operations take in big O notation? Doubling the value of each element in an array

O(n)

7. How long would each of these operations take in big O notation? Doubling the value of just the first element in an array

O(1)

8. How long would each of these operations take in big O notation? Creating a multiplication table with all the elements in the array. So if your array is [2, 3, 7, 8, 10], you first multiply every element by 2, then multiply every element by 3, then by 7, and so on.

```
       2    3    7    8   10
2   |  4 |  6 | 14 | 16 | 20  |
3   |  6 |  9 | 21 | 24 | 30  |
7   | 14 | 21 | 49 | 56 | 70  |
8   | 16 | 24 | 56 | 64 | 80  |
10  | 20 | 30 | 70 | 80 | 100 |
```

O(nÂ²)
